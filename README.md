# steam_workshop_downloader

Downloads and updates mods from the steam workshop using steamcmd and part of the implementation of https://github.com/f0rkz/pysteamcmd

# TODO

- use pycli or another framework
- add backup options to backup your current mod folder
- add states of the different mods as a recup when updating or installing
- try to find a way to know if a mod has been updated (maybe a checksum?)

# Project Management

I don't known when I'll ever work on this again. I'm open to pull requests
